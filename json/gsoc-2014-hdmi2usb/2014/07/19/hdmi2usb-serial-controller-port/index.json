{"title":"HDMI2USB Serial Controller Port","created_at":"2014-07-19 05:14:00 UTC","author":"Ajit (MJPEG Optimisation)","content":"<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\">When we connect HDMI2USB to host, two CDC are enumerated. One is for UVC(ACM0) and the other is for controller port(ACM1).<br />The controller port can be used to control certain features of HDMI2USB and also display status of USB, jpeg encoder etc.<br />To access this use any serial terminal program like gtkterm. The commands send to the control port is in ASCII. The ascii commands are two byte, first is the address(like U or u for USB TOP) and the second is the command you want to send to that address (like S or s for status). So if you send US, it will return the status of the USB Top module. Since the terminal I am using allows only hexadecimal commands, so I have to convert the ASCII commands to their hex equivalent (which is irritating).<br /><br />While creating the debug infrastructure, I completely neglected that there is already a lot of infrastructure already built in due to the control port. Some feature that I have added like frame rate etc can be exposed via the control port. Then we can have a debugger using the control port. Plus it can be used to control features of firmware which is even more awesome. What say mithro/shenki?</div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ajitmathewgsoc.blogspot.com/\">TimVideo GSoC 2014: MJPEG Optimisation</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
