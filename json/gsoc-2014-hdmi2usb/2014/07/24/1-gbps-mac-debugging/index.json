{"title":"1 Gbps MAC debugging","created_at":"2014-07-24 19:51:00 UTC","author":"Tariq (Ethernet Support)","content":"If you recall, last week, packets sent by <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1rzsZsz\">Packetizer</a> were getting dropped or were missing. It turned out that 1 Gbps MAC that is integrated with Packetizer was overflowing despite making sure all flow control protocols were followed while interfacing with the MAC. To deal with this, delay was inserted between each RTP packet so MAC never overruns. It fixed everything and you could see entire RED frame, RGB flag and RGB loop. The only thing that got hurt is the frame per second.<br /><br />So i am trying to figure out how to debug this MAC and get the fps up. I shall see if i could post some calculations of the current implementation.<br /><br />Happy Debugging.<br /><br /><br /><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://hdmi2ethernet.blogspot.com/\">GSOC 2014</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
