{"title":"Debugging Gstreamer and testing packetizer","created_at":"2014-07-16 05:35:00 UTC","author":"Tariq (Ethernet Support)","content":"It was a hectic day trying to get RTP to work using Gstreamer. The receiver is not working yet. I am experimenting with Gstreamer. It is an excellent tool. I really liked it. After reading documentation and bouncing back and forth on #gstreamer, i tried the following and its variation<br /><br />$gst-launch-1.0 -v GST_DEBUG=udpsrc:5 udpsrc uri=udp://192.168.1.1:1234 ! rtpbin ! rtpvrawdepay ! videoconvert ! autovideosink<br /><br />but it does not work. It seems that \"caps\" is missing.It documentation is little hard to digest. I am trying to debug that.<br /><br /><br />On the other hand, Packetizer is missing some packets. For example, when i am trying to send an entire frame (720x3 packets) via RTP, it misses some packets e.g., packets with sequence number 16-28 are missing. I am trying to debug that as well.<br /><br />I am hopeful i will be able to debug the Packetizer by tomorrow. I am hopeful to get to some point on Gstreamer by Thursday. If not, i will deal with image reconstruction in Pythonic way.<div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://hdmi2ethernet.blogspot.com/\">GSOC 2014</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
