Contributing to open source comes with it's own baggage like license, coding style and git, all of which I never cared about. But these are very important in an collaborative environment and hence important to learn. I got the bare bone version of my debug program working (with errors) and committed it. But before committing I remembered, \"Where is the license?\" So I copied the license from a VHDL file ( I know I am a smartass) and then happily committed it, feeling proud of my achievement. Only later I realised that it won't compile because to comment in VHDL we use \"--\" which will throw a compile error in C. Shenki must have been ROFLing on seeing it.<br /><br />Also I would like to propose daily tweeting instead of daily blogging. I haven't been blogging lately not because I was not working but blog, don't know why, sounds to&nbsp; me hard work, like the daily cursive writing my Mom used to make me write when I was a kid.<br /><br />Okay now I am rambling.
