{"title":"UDP  working on Atlys","created_at":"2014-07-04 07:04:00 UTC","author":"Tariq (Ethernet Support)","content":"Today was working on hardware (Atlys board) trying to get FPGA to send UDP packets to the PC.<br />The first attempt failed as the PC didn't have the 1G Ethernet card. The 2nd attempt took a while as the cable drivers were not installed. Its a big pain to get drivers installed on linux (Ubuntu 13.04 in particular). Finally i got that done and now UDP packets are being captured by Wireshark on the PC. Here is the snapshot.<br /><br />FPGA IP address = 192.168.1.2 (It is acting as source of UDP)<br />PC IP address &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 192.168.1.1 (It is acting as destination of UDP)<br /><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C23R4JSa0o0/U7ZRi-8gJVI/AAAAAAAAAJk/nB6G6yf-37k/s1600/wireshark_capture_udp.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C23R4JSa0o0/U7ZRi-8gJVI/AAAAAAAAAJk/nB6G6yf-37k/s1600/wireshark_capture_udp.jpg\" height=\"271\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br /><br />Time to send RTP packets piggybacked on UDP!!<div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://hdmi2ethernet.blogspot.com/\">GSOC 2014</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
