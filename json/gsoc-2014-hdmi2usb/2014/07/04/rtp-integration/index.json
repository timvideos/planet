{"title":"RTP Integration","created_at":"2014-07-04 20:17:00 UTC","author":"Tariq (Ethernet Support)","content":"Now that UDP is working on Atlys FGPA and i can send UDP packets from Atlys FGPA to PC, i am working on adding RTP on top of UDP. Since i already have the RTP packetizer that interfaces with MAC, the only thing that is left is replacing the input <b>simulation</b> model to RTP packetizer (that provides it with pixels) with actual <b>synthesizable</b> model. I have HDMI pixel data dumped in a file, which is being read by RTP packetizer to create RTP packets. But now, i need something like DDR2 or RAM that holds this data. This stackoverflow <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4321067/is-readmem-synthesizable-in-verilog\">post</a>&nbsp;may be good enough as well. Let me try that and update the blog.<br /><br />Its 4th of July holiday in US. Time to take a break as my family is coming to visit me for the day. I will keep it going on the weekend.<div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://hdmi2ethernet.blogspot.com/\">GSOC 2014</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
