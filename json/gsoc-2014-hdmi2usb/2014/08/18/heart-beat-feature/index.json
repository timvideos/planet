{"title":"Heart Beat Feature","created_at":"2014-08-18 08:21:00 UTC","author":"Ajit (MJPEG Optimisation)","content":"<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\">If a static is being displayed by HDMI2USB (for example a slide in a presentation), then it is difficult to tell whether the HDMI2USB is working or it is hung. So a heart beat feature has been added which causes a block of pixel to pulse in the lower right corner of the screen indicating that HDMI2USB is alive.<br /><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to control?</h4><div>Heart Beat (HB) can be switched on/off using switch SW 0 or using the CDC control port by sending ASCII command \"S(s)\" and \"H(h)\". But the control port will work only when the switch is on. So the switch acts as a \"hard off\" signal.</div><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to tweak the pulse?</h4><div>The heart beat module is instantiated in the image_selector module. To change height, width and pulsing rate of the pixels, change the generics HB_length, HB_width and alt_aft_frame in hdl/misc/image_selector.vhd file.</div><div><br /></div><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://youtu.be/hsOfT9qg4hI\">Video</a></h4></div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ajitmathewgsoc.blogspot.com/\">TimVideo GSoC 2014: MJPEG Optimisation</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
