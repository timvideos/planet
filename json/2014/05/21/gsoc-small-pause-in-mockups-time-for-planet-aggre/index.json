I have small problems with my internet connection today and I couldn't find any answers in the internet so I had to find solution without any help. <br /><br />It is easy task if you have newest Jekyll. Simply you should use planet.rb from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/pote/planet.rb\">https://github.com/pote/planet.rb</a>&nbsp;to generate news and everything should work out of the box. But it seems that it is not so easy on old Jekyll like ours (which is 0.12.1). On Jekyllrb.com you have only newest documentation and configuration and commands has changed a lot since 0.12.1 release, so currently I am searching the Internet for documentation, I hope I will find it soon.<br /><br />Meanwhile I would like to present you first version of new mockup for Tim Videos website:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tClOAuIXyTs/U30nsfnYNzI/AAAAAAAAH64/QDL0wHJk9uc/s1600/Screen+Shot+05-21-14+at+05.06+PM.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tClOAuIXyTs/U30nsfnYNzI/AAAAAAAAH64/QDL0wHJk9uc/s1600/Screen+Shot+05-21-14+at+05.06+PM.PNG\" height=\"175\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">As I said I would like to create modular website with blocks like this. Number of columns that you can see on the screen will adapt to screen resolution, so you will always see content, with full-width website.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">I hope you like it. :) I will present more screens soon, after I did Planet aggregation.</div><br /><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://pinoit.blogspot.com\">pino IT / ruby / developer</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
