Normally CDC ACM ports use 4 EPs but these seem to use 2 EPs - bulk in and bulk out. That means 6 more serial ports can be implemented. Will be programming my board and verify with lsusb</li><li>Wondering if no. of extra serial ports needed is to be dynamically changed as the board resets. If so, on what basis. Also wondering how this fits with the Numato board. The proposed config for two rigid serial ports mapped to PTZ and GPIO seems to do fine.</li><li>Cuttable PCB tracks seems like a good way to make serial expansion board configurable in terms of which VHDCI pins to use.</li><li>Finished <a href=\"http://gitimmersion.com/\" target=\"_blank\">gitimmersion</a>&nbsp;lab 20, should complete all by next day.</li></ul></div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ptzfortimvideos-gsoc14.blogspot.com/\">Serial port expansion for HDMI2USB with PTZ camera control example</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
