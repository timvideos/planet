A friend of mine was kind enough to lend me his HD monitor for the summer as he will be interning in Japan. I usually work do my fpga stuff on Windows but as everyone in the org uses linux I installed ISE on ubuntu. I did receive my board last week and was planning to get it running by the end of this week. Unfortunately I couldn't. I was able to successfully complete the flashing the FPGA with HDMI2USB firmware using Adept tool and generate test pattern on the monitor. Then I flashed the Cypress Fx2 chip with HDMI2USB firmware using the latest version of fxload. But when I tried the dmesg command, the output did not show HDMI2SB as aUSB device.<br />Posted the problem on irc, waiting for some help.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qXJcOwSBgGE/U3gROKDiCaI/AAAAAAAAAGw/umkuv7Mgbl4/w733-h550-no/20140517_123140.jpg\">Test image</a>&nbsp;</div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ajitmathewgsoc.blogspot.com/\">TimVideo GSoC 2014: MJPEG Optimisation</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
