I also has full mobile support out of the box, so I can focus on creating the website without thinking about every part of responsive design.<br /><br />Harish Chouhan wrote great post about Bootrap advantages:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ostraining.com/blog/coding/bootstrap/\">http://www.ostraining.com/blog/coding/bootstrap/</a>.<br /><br /><b>Mockups</b><br />After I have chosen the framework I started to prepare some mockups. I created two mockups of main page of the website. Those mockups show in which direction I would like to go with the website, color scheme, main menu etc.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">1.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EdWpzTeCsbU/U29Nv0PNC_I/AAAAAAAAH1k/VxyMeERx77E/s1600/Timvideos1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EdWpzTeCsbU/U29Nv0PNC_I/AAAAAAAAH1k/VxyMeERx77E/s1600/Timvideos1.png\" height=\"239\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">2.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0t_SL3TBotE/U29Nv7V3i3I/AAAAAAAAH1o/Btr5bhBfr2w/s1600/Timvideos2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0t_SL3TBotE/U29Nv7V3i3I/AAAAAAAAH1o/Btr5bhBfr2w/s1600/Timvideos2.png\" height=\"259\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />I have decided to use three main colors from TimVideos logo. In my opinion those colors are perfectly matched and should be used on developers website.<br /><br />I would like to know your opinion about mockups, personally I prefer number 2, but the choice is yours. :)<div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://pinoit.blogspot.com\">pino IT / ruby / developer</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
