Unfortunately, I'm currently in midst of my End Semester exams and hence not able to relish the joy of starting work on the project. Instead, there is immense exam pressure. Sigh!<br /><br />But, I'm not idle on this front either! Yesterday, I tried the <a href=\"http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/I3C2\" target=\"_blank\">I3C2 controller</a> from <a href=\"http://hamsterworks.co.nz/\">Hamsterworks.co.nz</a>. This project will be using some kind of I2C core to send initialization and configuration commands to the AD9984A IC. And, the I3C2 controller looks like a good option. So, I decided to try it in my spare break time during exam studies. Bit stream is generated, I just have to upload it on Atlys and test it with PCF8574, a GPIO Expander IC, suitable for testing the I2C controller. Will keep updated in this!<br /><br />See you after exams. Got to go, bye! </div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://dreamsxtrinsic.blogspot.com/\">Dreams eXtrinsic</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
