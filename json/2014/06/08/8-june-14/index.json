This method gives network speed fairly close to as measured by other online speedtests. </li>\n<li>I toyed with html2canvas and implemented a dummy. </li>\n<li>I was wondering about the possible options we have for storing the generated client-end screenshots. I talked to skay and we came up with the following: \n\n<ul>\n<li>Use a web service like s3 (AWS)</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://api.imgur.com/\">Imgur API</a>. It offers a limit of 1250 uploads per day, according to docs. We can also apply for getting our app white-listed because it&rsquo;s free for all. </li>\n<li>Save them locally on our server. </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Thought for the day</h3>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Never let the perfect be the enemy of the good&rdquo;: Don&rsquo;t delay something in order to make it perfect when it already is good enough. </p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://niharika.svbtle.com\">Niharika Kohli</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
