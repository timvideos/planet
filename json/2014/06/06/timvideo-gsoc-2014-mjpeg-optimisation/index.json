After initial hiccups I was finally able to do it. Also I underclocked the DDR2 Ram to check if there is a change in frame rate. When clock was reduced by half there was no change and when I reduced it further mplayer showed a timeout error.<br />@shenki: I have added a new commit with the <a href=\"https://github.com/ajitmathew/HDMI2USB/commit/78a97676ac6f9163bf5f5751f4597046b86c3e2b\">xsvf files</a>. Try them on your board and please tell me the frame rate you observed. </div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ajitmathewgsoc.blogspot.com/\">TimVideo GSoC 2014: MJPEG Optimisation</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
