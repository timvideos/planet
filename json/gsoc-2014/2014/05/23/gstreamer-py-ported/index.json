The two tests (out of six) that were <a href=\"http://portingflumotion.blogspot.in/2013/06/gstreamerpy-and-testcommongstreamerpy_20.html\">failing</a> last year were due to some changes in the gst.caps_from_string function. While gst returned a caps object that could be converted directly to string using python str() method, gi requires using to_string() method of caps object.</p>\n\n<p>Another problem is that despite presence of gi in sys.modules, twisted is importing gtk2reactor which it shouldn’t be doing. I haven’t been able to figure out the reason for this so I had to comment the __init__ of tests module, for now.</p>\n\n<p>Also, trying to create a test stream given following error:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">Twisted traceback:\nTraceback from remote host -- Traceback unavailable\nflumotion.common.errors.RemoteRunError: RemoteRunError on method <span class=\"s1\">&#39;module flumotion.worker.checks.check could not be imported (exception ImportError at flumotion/common/package.py:54: import_module(): No module named &#39;</span>gi<span class=\"s1\">&#39;)&#39;</span></code></pre></div>\n\n<p>FIXME: fix problems with gtk2reactor and uncomment __init__.py</p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://aps-sids.github.io/porting-flumotion\">Porting Flumotion - GSoC '14 Progress Blog</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
