{"title":"Ubuntu on VirtualBox? Pain in the arse","created_at":"2014-05-12 18:12:24 UTC","author":"Niharika (Bug reporting system)","content":"<p>I had Ubuntu on VirtualBox already on my Windows 7, but somehow, never really contemplated using it for any serious work. This was mainly because my perception of Virtual machines went like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They are slow</li>\n<li>They are really slow</li>\n<li>They might not connect to the internet all that well</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Turns out I was wrong on counts 2 and 3, but they are a bit slow, for sure. I also faced some issues with flickering icons etc, probably due to low RAM etc.</p>\n\n<p>So today I spent my day upgrading the 10.04 on my VM to 12.04 and expanding the RAM and disc space in hope that it will improve the speed. \nPhew.</p>\n\n<p>Tasks for tomorrow: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Install Git. </li>\n<li>Learn some Ubuntu commands and howtos. </li>\n<li>SSH into rackspace VM from this VM. </li>\n<li>Eat some momos. </li>\n</ul><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://niharika.svbtle.com\">Niharika Kohli</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
