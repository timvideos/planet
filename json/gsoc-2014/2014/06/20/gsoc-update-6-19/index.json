(should be complete by tomorrow)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In essence, conference setup workflow will look like:\n1. fill out config.private.json\n2. run <code>python host_generate.py</code> with same options as you would in pushconfig.py (new file)\n3. fill in host connection details \n4. run something like <code>fab pushconfigs</code> to push correct configurations out to hosts\n5. run something like <code>fab serve</code> to start the streaming system.</p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://mstritzi.nfshost.com/blog\">Max Stritzinger</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
