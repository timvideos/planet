{"title":"A C++ speed-me-up trick","created_at":"2014-10-16 09:05:17 UTC","author":"Niharika (Bug reporting system)","content":"<p>After a couple of months of wondering how to wrap up this blog, I decided to keep it anyway. I&rsquo;ll use it for posting random tricks/tutorials whenever I get time.</p>\n\n<p>I recently got my toes back into competitive programming, something I hadn&rsquo;t touched for over a year, and realized how much I&rsquo;d missed it. <a href=\"http://www.codechef.com/problems/FATCHEF\">Here</a>&rsquo;s an interesting problem I came across. It&rsquo;s pretty simple from the programming perspective, needing you to know simple combinatorics (not even that, actually). Anyway, I coded it up pretty quickly and hit submit but, voila, it exceeded time constraints. I was quite sure I had the right algo, it is an O(n) solution after all. But nothing seemed to make it work, I gave up after hacking on it for a couple of days. </p>\n\n<p>Today I went back to the Practice section, dug up my old code and added this to it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The program ran almost 4x as fast as earlier, on my own system. This is a neat trick if you&rsquo;re using cin/cout (C++) and want to speed up your program. I read it in one of the very first blog posts on Codeforces. Cool, huh?</p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://niharika.svbtle.com\">Niharika Kohli</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
