{"title":"[GSoC] What happenned during last weeks?","created_at":"2014-07-13 22:21:00 UTC","author":"Maciej (Developer Website)","content":"I would like to apologize, that I haven't written any summarize post during last 2 weeks, but I wanted to end one big part of my project and then summarize it in bigger post. I am doing it right now. :)<br /><br />Last weeks I spend working with GitHub Issues and Supybot configuration. I did a lot of research and read a lot of articles about organizing work with issues, about supybot configuration, etc.<br />Then I started working with supybot, after few days I created final configuration for RSS changes notification with Supybot and added it to my GitHub:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/pinoss/supybot-configuration\">https://github.com/pinoss/supybot-configuration</a><br /><br />After working with Supybot I started working with GitHub Issues. I found nice applications and articles about Issues and I wrote about them here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://pinoit.blogspot.com/2014/07/gsoc-snippet-04072014.html\">http://pinoit.blogspot.com/2014/07/gsoc-snippet-04072014.html</a><br /><br />Then I started working with Issues, I created some mockups and started creating filter/search engine.<br /><br />And I created GitHub Issues plugin for Jekyll to download all issues and generated and presented them on Issues page, after that I added input autocomplete for author, assignee and title to make search easier.<br /><br />Then I started refactoring Javascripts and I changes all variable names in JavaScripts to camelCase, then I was ready to add first filter engine for author, assignee and title fields.<br /><br />After that I changed _config.yml configuration and grouped rss settings into single node. After that I added new field to config.yml with list of special filters based on labels of Issues and modified JavaScript filter engine to support these special filters.<br /><br />Then I added few small filters: labels, state, milestones and changed markdown engine in issues to GitHub Flavored Markdown.<br /><br /><br />Now I will work on Getting Started deployment process, I will try moving generation of website to Travis CI and then integrate that site with Planet. Then I want to fix some small CSS/JS problems and start working with Integration Planet with social media pages (notifying about new posts). I also have some tasks in backlog and I will work with them. :)<div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://pinoit.blogspot.com\">pino IT / ruby / developer</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
