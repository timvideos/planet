I generate Edit and Delete  links in django-tables2 table dynamically, but they don&rsquo;t seem to work. I tried a lot of different things but nothing helps. \nI raised the question on Stackoverflow <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24868947/django-tables2-linkcolumn-link-doesnt-work\">here</a>. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll resolve this soon. </p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://niharika.svbtle.com\">Niharika Kohli</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
