The Ubuntu maintainers didn&rsquo;t stock the latest version, so I had to get it from the vagrant website directly. I ran a &lsquo;vagrant up&rsquo; after the installation completed and got the following error message:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Warning: Connection timeout. Retrying...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This went on for about twenty times after which it terminated indicating error in networking of box. I looked up online and found several &lsquo;fixes&rsquo; but none of them worked for me yet. I will exercise my other option and try to run the app on Windows itself tomorrow. I&rsquo;ve vagrant on Windows already, so it should not be much problematic. </p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://niharika.svbtle.com\">Niharika Kohli</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
