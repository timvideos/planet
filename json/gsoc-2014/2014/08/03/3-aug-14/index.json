I setup my repo as remote and updated the box. I also updated the PROJECT_ROOT in production.py. Now the CSS files load, but JS ones don&rsquo;t. Weird. </p>\n\n<p>I learnt about the grep and pipes command from Sheila. She also told me how we could write our own bash functions to shorten queries or commands. </p>\n\n<p>Tasks for tomorrow:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Get the JS files to load</li>\n<li>Setup the postgresql db on server</li>\n</ul><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://niharika.svbtle.com\">Niharika Kohli</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
