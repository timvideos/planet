The JS and CSS files are not getting loaded, that&rsquo;s an issue I will deal with tomorrow. Here&rsquo;s some bugs and errors we encountered while deploying the website:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Secret key was missing. Sheila suggested I save it off the VM and add it to gitignore. I did that, but the commit didn&rsquo;t deploy on VM. Error code 128. So I saved the key on an environment variable in the box itself, which worked.</li>\n<li>Next up, the URL gave a 500. Logs told us: ImproperlyConfigured: Secret-key. This meant that the environment variable isn&rsquo;t loading before a=out app runs. So we added it to the deployment/runserver.sh.j2 Jinja file.</li>\n<li>Another 500. It wanted a default Cache which we hadn&rsquo;t configured. We decided to use locmemcache for now with the website.</li>\n<li>A 400 this time. Skay figured that we needed to set ALLOWED_HOSTS. She setup the domain name and I put it in the repo. \nAnd voila! It works! </li>\n</ul><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://niharika.svbtle.com\">Niharika Kohli</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
