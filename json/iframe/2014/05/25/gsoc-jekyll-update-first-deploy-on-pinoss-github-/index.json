In current week I did not have as many time as I wanted to spend on Tim Videos project. But I've successfully deployed Tim Videos website with first changes (planet aggregator and feed.xml) on my Github Pages: <a href=\"http://pinoss.github.io/\">http://pinoss.github.io</a>.<br /><br />I've also updated Jekyll to the newest possible version (2.0.3), so now working with Jekyll is easier (because of new features like serving pages locally). I've also updated our plugins, but unfortunately porting our custom plugin Wikilinks was not possible, because now Converter class in Jekyll has no information about all pages and cannot search for website with selected title and add an url. I've partially resolved it by creating new Liquid tag - page_url, but still it won't be compatible with Github Wiki. Because of that I've decided to speed up my work on edit interface (prose.io) and remove need of using Github Wiki to update content.<br /><br />Currently I am cleaning up the website, adding pretty urls and resolving backwards compatibility.<br />Meanwhile I will work also on mockups, I didn't receive your feedback about my last mockup, I will create more mockups soon and wait for your response. :)<div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://pinoit.blogspot.com\">pino IT / ruby / developer</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
