{"title":"Changed Gtk2reactor To Gtk3reactor","content":"---\ntitle: \"Changed Gtk2Reactor to Gtk3Reactor\"\nkind: article\ncreated_at: 2014-05-24 07:00:00 UTC\nauthor: Amanpreet (Porting Flumotion)\nimage: https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2363074?s=50\ncategories: GSoC-2014\ntags: \"news flumotion\"\nlayout: post\n---<p>With the help of a mentor, I figured out the cause of the error in previous post (ported gstreamer.py). This was due to flumotion using Gtk2Reactor which is incompatible with gi. So, I changed it to use Gtk3Reactor.</p>\n\n<p>Tests fail since there is still some use of gobject, particularly in flumotion/common/boot.py, which cannot be mixed with gi. This is causing the error and consequently some tests fail.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to this, while changing the reactor to gtk3reactor, I noticed that pygtk2 is a dependency for flumotion which also needs to be ported since its not compatible with gi. Also, it uses a wrapper framework named kiwi that’s unmaintained so that might need to be replaced as well (I don’t know replaced with what, yet).</p>\n\n<p>TODO:  Port PyGTK to PyGObject (aka PyGI)</p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://aps-sids.github.io/porting-flumotion\">Porting Flumotion - GSoC '14 Progress Blog</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
