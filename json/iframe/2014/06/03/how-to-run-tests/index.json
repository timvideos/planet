So, I’ve created a <code>working-tests.txt</code> and a <code>run_tests.sh</code> to read this file and run the tests. As a result, Travis build is passing now as seen on badge on sidebar of this blog.</p>\n\n<p>Again with the Gstreamer version 1.2.1 issues, some overrides are not implemented (like Gst.Fraction class). So, I’m adding the implementation myself (which I shall remove when the whole thing is ported).</p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://aps-sids.github.io/porting-flumotion\">Porting Flumotion - GSoC '14 Progress Blog</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
