They&rsquo;ll last till 10th, but I hope to find some time in-between the exam days to work on my project. Over the past week I have gathered better command over Django and, in turn, the streaming system. I&rsquo;ll be able to focus more after the exams, but will keep getting used to it whenever time permits. </p>\n\n<p>As of now, I am focusing on how I can fetch the system information using JavaScript and how I can create the form using Django. </p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://niharika.svbtle.com\">Niharika Kohli</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
