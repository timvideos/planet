{"title":"[GSoC] What happenned during this week? (week 5)","created_at":"2014-06-26 17:11:00 UTC","author":"Maciej (Developer Website)","content":"It was a great month, I learned a lot about Jekyll and Ruby, wrote a lot of new plugins, contributed to planet.rb and my first GitHub pull request. A lot of great work was made thanks to GSoC and TimVideos organization, thank you guys. :) I am really satisfied about my work during this month and can't wait to see results of my work in next 2 months.<br /><br />During this week I spend a lot of time on integrating <a href=\"http://planet.timvideos.us/\">planet.timvideos.us</a>&nbsp;with GitHub API to get a lot of information from GitHub repositories and integrating edit interface (<a href=\"http://prose.io/\">prose.io</a>) to work with our getting-started page.<br /><br />On edit interface I've added prose.io realistic preview to every edit, so you will see your changes with realistic preview, I've also added edit button to every editable part of website to make editing easier.<br /><br />I've created GitHub Statistic page on planet (<a href=\"http://planet.timvideos.us/stats/\">http://planet.timvideos.us/stats/</a>), I've added there 5 charts per project and worked on presenting data to the user, I still have to fix some small issues with charts but almost all is done with that part.<br /><br />I've also created People page on planet (<a href=\"http://planet.timvideos.us/people/\">http://planet.timvideos.us/people/</a>) with information about people related to TimVideos community, and almost all data is fetched from GitHub page (avatar, blog url, name, location, etc.), but you can also override that information if you want to customize it a little bit.<br /><br />I've also made some small changes, like moving from prose.io application into gh-pages branch of my prose fork.<br /><br />Now I will work at IRC notifications about updates and start working on page with issues.<div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://pinoit.blogspot.com\">pino IT / ruby / developer</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
