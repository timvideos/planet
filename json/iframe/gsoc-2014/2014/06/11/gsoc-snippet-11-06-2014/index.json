I can't find any causes of that problem, I am trying to find reasons of that behavior, there are 2 possible problems:<br />- order of generation plugins is not deterministic if all plugins have same priority, maybe on servers there is another priority that causes problems, I am trying to give plugins correct order, but since all works correctly on my machine I have to experiment on server. Second possible reason is Ruby version, I haven't installed Ruby 1.9.3 on my machine but I need to do that to make sure that everything work correctly.<br /><b>[code]</b> Added Emoji support, but it has some incompatibility with Ruby 1.9.3 and causes problems with generation, so I reverted my changes. I need to update Ruby on servers or rewrite plugin to use 1.9.3.<br /><br /><i><u>Plans for tomorrow/next days:</u></i><br /><b>[code]</b> add feeds per all categories and tags (rss xml and opml)<br /><b>[code] </b>add import tag information from RSS feed<br /><b>[code] </b>add inform on irc if new page has been generated<div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://pinoit.blogspot.com\">pino IT / ruby / developer</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
