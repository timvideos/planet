{"title":"Audiotest ported and a problem with blocking probes","created_at":"2014-06-14 07:00:00 UTC","author":"Amanpreet (Porting Flumotion)","content":"<p>I went ahead and completed porting of Audiotest producer, volume effects and Vorbis encoder. With this, I successfully created and “listened” the test audio stream.</p>\n\n<p>But, when I tried adding both Videotest and Audiotest components together, the ogg muxer component did not run successfully.</p>\n\n<p>The main reason for this seems to be error while trying to link srcpad and sinkpad as evident from the following traceback. I suspect this might be due to problem in adding and removing of blocking probes as well.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"bash\">  File <span class=\"s2\">&quot;/home/aps/workspace/gsoc/flumotion-orig/cache/component/524cbc57eee2c130a83653aa7be9bcbc/flumotion/component/feedcomponent.py&quot;</span>, line 153, in gotFeed\n    self.comp.eatFromFD<span class=\"o\">(</span>eaterAlias, feedId, fd<span class=\"o\">)</span>\n  File <span class=\"s2\">&quot;/home/aps/workspace/gsoc/flumotion-orig/cache/component/524cbc57eee2c130a83653aa7be9bcbc/flumotion/component/feedcomponent010.py&quot;</span>, line 931, in eatFromFD\n    srcpad.link<span class=\"o\">(</span>sinkpad<span class=\"o\">)</span>\n  File <span class=\"s2\">&quot;/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/overrides/Gst.py&quot;</span>, line 102, in link\n    raise LinkError<span class=\"o\">(</span>ret<span class=\"o\">)</span>\ngi.overrides.Gst.LinkError: &lt;enum GST_PAD_LINK_NOFORMAT of <span class=\"nb\">type </span>GstPadLinkReturn&gt;\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This error means linking failed because the caps of two pads weren’t compatible.</p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://aps-sids.github.io/porting-flumotion\">Porting Flumotion - GSoC '14 Progress Blog</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
