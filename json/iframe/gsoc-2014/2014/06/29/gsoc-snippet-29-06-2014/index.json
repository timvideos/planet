Supybot checks for changes in RSS for every 15 minutes and sends a message to irc channel. I've used and tested it on my test chanel on freenode, tomorrow I will add that bot to our server to run on actually used channel.<br /><br />Finally I've passed all my exams and now I will have more time for work. :)<div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://pinoit.blogspot.com\">pino IT / ruby / developer</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
