The way I was doing it before was starting with an Ubuntu container and just manually pulling and configuring the container the way it should be and afterwards running a docker commit. I think this is the wrong way to do things and have made a Dockerfile for each of the separate images. streamingsystem/base has everything needed to run each component and each component simply uses the base and runs/configures on top of it. I'm not sure how much I like this though, given that the website doesn't need flumotion just as the flumotion components don't need to run the website... undecided if it matters so much</li>\n<li>in accordance with what I posted about a week ago, I have been working on changing some of the configuration files and scripts to grab environment variables to be passed to the application</li>\n<li>done with school now, so I'll really be able to kick into gear starting next week. </li>\n</ul><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://mstritzi.nfshost.com/blog\">Max Stritzinger</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
