I installed vagrant, but it&rsquo;s version 1.0.1, far from being the latest. Upgrading to the latest version needs me to remove this and reinstall the new one. Also, skay suggested that it might become heavy on the VM at some point, so I am contemplating trying deploying the app on Windows itself. I&rsquo;ll try and be done with this part by tomorrow.</p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://niharika.svbtle.com\">Niharika Kohli</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
