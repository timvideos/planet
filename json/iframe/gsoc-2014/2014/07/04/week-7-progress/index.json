{"title":"Week 7 Progress","created_at":"2014-07-04 00:00:00 UTC","author":"Amanpreet (Porting Flumotion)","content":"<p>I’ve been traveling for past 3 days for some university related work. But, I have been working on my project as well. I somehow got an internet connection for posting this update.</p>\n\n<p>First thing I did was porting of the disker consumer after fixing some issues. After this was ported, I was able to save the output from Videotest + Audiotest components to my disk as an OGG file.</p>\n\n<p>Other than that, I fixed the problems with the “Feeder component Test” and it passes the test now. Basically, the feeder component is now using GstStructure instead of a simple tuple, but the test was sending a tuple. I changed that to send a GstStructure and test pass now.</p>\n\n<p>I am going to work on other components in coming days.</p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://aps-sids.github.io/porting-flumotion\">Porting Flumotion - GSoC '14 Progress Blog</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
