I have two major tasks left to do now:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Setup the app on a server</li>\n<li>Link it to the streaming system so that I can fetch the stream title and video stats and also take the screenshot. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I suspect the latter to be most difficult. After that, I can spend time testing and add-on features in the Admin panel. </p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://niharika.svbtle.com\">Niharika Kohli</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
