It has ability to create own Board with multiple repositories and have all Issues grouped in one place, you can add as many columns as you wish, filter by milestones, assigned, sources, etc. And there are a lot of people using it. :)<br /><br /><i>What is next/my plans to the end of GSoC 2014?</i><br />1. Work with <b>feedbook</b> (add Google+ integration, write offline mode and more tests to make sure, that all works correctly). [next few days]<br />2. Update our document about deployment process of <b>getting-started </b>website (and create and deploy as many as I can (because of permissions)) [tomorrow/day after tomorrow]<br />3. Integrate <b>planet </b>with <b>getting-started</b>.<br />4. Extract my written Jekyll plugins into GitHub projects and share code with the others (and add some tests of course).<br />5. Small CSS/HTML fixes and enhancements.<br />6. Add Diagram to my GitHub Issues Filter.<br />7. Add acceptance/integration tests for planet and getting-started website.<br /><br /><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://pinoit.blogspot.com\">pino IT / ruby / developer</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
