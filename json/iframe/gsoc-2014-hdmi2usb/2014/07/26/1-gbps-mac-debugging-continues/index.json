{"title":"1 Gbps MAC Debugging continues","created_at":"2014-07-26 04:36:00 UTC","author":"Tariq (Ethernet Support)","content":"I tried to debug the MAC. I found something weird and that was Wireshark was capturing all the packets while Gstreamer was not capturing the same packets and still waiting for some packets. I am trying to debug this further for more packets (for a complete 720p frame and back to back frames). I suspect from debugging today that MAC is fine. I'll confirm this soon.<br /><br />Happy Debugging.<div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://hdmi2ethernet.blogspot.com/\">GSOC 2014</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
