Things will improve as other developers add stuff to the debug infrastructure like packet count, expansion boards ID etc. <br />There are two bugs which I couldn't fix even after hours of attempt:&nbsp; <br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>UART is suddenly send incorrect data causing wrong output for a moment.</li><li>HDMI 1 is shown connected even though only one is connected.</li></ul>I will spend some more time on it in the weekend.<br /><br />Tomorrow I am planning to go back to the real stuff I am working on. Tomorrow I will try to add another encoder. Let's see if it is possible. If not, atleast we will know that this solution is not possible for available fpga resource.<br /><br />Till then I am going to sleep. </div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ajitmathewgsoc.blogspot.com/\">TimVideo GSoC 2014: MJPEG Optimisation</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
