The simulation worked just fine. After that it was time to do the Xilinx build flow to make the RTP go across the 1 Gbps network. It took more than an hour to get the build flow finish. And lo and behold, i was struck by <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/6Q8Ph6Gu\">timing violations</a>. Time to fix this by re-coding.<br /><br />Debug mode continues<div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://hdmi2ethernet.blogspot.com/\">GSOC 2014</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
