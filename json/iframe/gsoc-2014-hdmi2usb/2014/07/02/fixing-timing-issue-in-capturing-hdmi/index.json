{"title":"Fixing timing issue in capturing HDMI","created_at":"2014-07-02 04:09:00 UTC","author":"Tariq (Ethernet Support)","content":"The HDMI traffic that is generated is not being properly captured. At the moment, this is being debugged. Simulation is an integral part of this project which is missing in its sister project. The goal is to send real traffic so that at the destination we know what we are receiving. Right now RGB values get out of synchronization. Synchronization is so important. I have the necessary blocks to send HDMI data as Ethernet frames but the goal is to send right HDMI values which are with respect HSYNC and VSYNC.<br /><br />Here is one snapshot which shows HCOUNT and VCOUNT not consistent with sys_clk.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2wnte3d&amp;s=8#.U7NwtB__6b5\">HDMI Frame 1st row of pixels</a><br /><br />It will be debugged by tomorrow hopefully.<br /><br />The <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSjfm6eS0B3UUPJmPf7PH0tNsF7ZFKIKfPldmF3ucKY/edit#heading=h.fnxxz0x6v3xd\">Spec</a> will be updated tomorrow with what constitutes the right RGB values i.e., which RGB values need to be sent and which ones to be ignored.<br /><br />The immediate plan is<br /><br />1) to send the synchronized RGB as RTP packets via Ethernet and test it if they are being received correctly at the hardware level.<br /><br /><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://hdmi2ethernet.blogspot.com/\">GSOC 2014</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
