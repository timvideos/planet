{"title":"1 Gbps MAC debugging continues on the weekend","created_at":"2014-07-28 04:31:00 UTC","author":"Tariq (Ethernet Support)","content":"Today, it turned out that 1 Gbps MAC was actually dropping packets. I tried to debug this by<br /><br />1) Creating simulation environment for the entire design (packetizer + MAC)<br />2) Changing transmit fifo depth in gigmac from 6 to 12 and up<br />3) Creating internal reset for packetizer as the actual design gets reset externally from FPGA. Look at lines 148-155<br /><a href=\"http://pastebin.com/HXmiiGU0\">http://pastebin.com/HXmiiGU0</a><br /><br />Right now, simulation is not working as gemac_ready signal (see above pastebin) which is reset for packetizer is still not toggling. I shall look at it tomorrow Monday, although Monday is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr\">special day.</a><br /><br />If this doesn't really work, then&nbsp; Chipscope is the next step. There is a possibility that 1 Gbps MAC cannot handle such high HDMI throughput but that is what i am after to confirm.<br /><br />Happy Debugging. <br /><br /><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://hdmi2ethernet.blogspot.com/\">GSOC 2014</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
