{"title":"Hellooo World!!","created_at":"2014-05-01 05:22:00 UTC","author":"Ajit (MJPEG Optimisation)","content":"<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\">I am elated to work for TimVideos.us this summer as part of the Google Summer of Code programme. I will be working on optimisation of MJPEG core of HDMI2USB device. Currently the MJPEG core works at 15 fps and I have to improve it to 120 fps which is a challenging task.<br /><br />I will be writing more about the project and the work I am planning to do in my later blog. Right now I am just happy to set the ball rolling.</div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ajitmathewgsoc.blogspot.com/\">TimVideo GSoC 2014: MJPEG Optimisation</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
