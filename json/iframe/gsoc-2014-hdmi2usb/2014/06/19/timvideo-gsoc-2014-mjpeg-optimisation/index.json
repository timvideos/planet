{"title":"TimVideo GSoC 2014: MJPEG Optimisation","created_at":"2014-06-19 22:11:00 UTC","author":"Ajit (MJPEG Optimisation)","content":"<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\">Today I completed the coding part for the simulation of HDMI2USB. The main aim for this was to check whether the read and write pattern used in DDR2 Ram is optimum. For this I removed all the parts which did not affect the read and write performance of DDR2 Ram like EDID, USB etc. The&nbsp; only problem is that the simulation takes up a lot of time. It takes upto 4 hrs for the calibration of DDR2 ram. I am currently simulating it. I will wake up and check the waveforms. </div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ajitmathewgsoc.blogspot.com/\">TimVideo GSoC 2014: MJPEG Optimisation</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
