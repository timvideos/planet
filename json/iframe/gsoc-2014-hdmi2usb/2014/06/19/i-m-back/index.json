{"title":"I'm Back!","created_at":"2014-06-19 02:31:00 UTC","author":"Ajit (MJPEG Optimisation)","content":"<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\">Finally I am back from my trip to US. The competition didn't go the way I wanted it to be. Our cansat did not send any telemetry. Also it landed in a sunflower field which meant we could not recover the cansat and the onboard memory which had all the telemetry data. But it was a good learning experience, plus I got a chance to meet people from all over the world which was great.<br />I will resume working on the project. I will continue my work on simulating the HDMI2USB firmware. Hopefully, I will be able to come up with something fruitful by the end of this week. </div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ajitmathewgsoc.blogspot.com/\">TimVideo GSoC 2014: MJPEG Optimisation</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
