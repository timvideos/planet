And rest of them without flow control?</b><br />- A majority of serial devices work without flow control, and even these PTZ cameras may work without flow control at very low baud rate. But I don't have PTZ cameras to test so I wouldn't want to take chances.<br />- And there is another question left for us. <b>Do CDC ACM drivers support Bulk only CDC ACM serial port, i.e. the ones without INT IN endpoint?</b><br />- Flow control is also a concern with the Numato board design, because that also seems to ignore RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR flow control. Only RX, TX is used in the schematics that I was shown. While this would work with RS422 pretty well, it might not work with RS232C based cameras.</div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ptzfortimvideos-gsoc14.blogspot.com/\">Serial port expansion for HDMI2USB with PTZ camera control example</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
