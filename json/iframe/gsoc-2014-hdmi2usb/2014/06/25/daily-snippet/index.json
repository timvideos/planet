Two of the UARTs also share the only 2 available hardware I2C ports, so I2C for daughterboard auto-detection have to be bitbanged.</li><li>Understood PIC18F85J94 PPS-Lite multiplexer. Learnt using the PIC18F85J94 pin-usage spreadsheet made by Tim and filled it up with new pin assignments.</li><li>Went through clocking modes for the above. It turns out that it's internal Fast RC clock (FRC) source has at least 0.25% accuracy required by USB 2.0. However, I've also given the choice of putting a crystal.</li><li>Rearranged file structure of my repo and started daughterboard schematics.</li></ul><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ptzfortimvideos-gsoc14.blogspot.com/\">Serial port expansion for HDMI2USB with PTZ camera control example</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
