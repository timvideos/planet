I configured the configuration bits to use quad-buffering and built the binary. Will be testing out difference in FPS performance. Here's a temporary <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/o1qp82wfsrztue7/hdmi2usb.hex\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>&nbsp;to download the binary.</li><li>The current situation with Cypress FX2LP needs us to significantly change our ways of integrating serial devices to HDMI2USB; the Cypress - FPGA route does not seem to work</li><li>It seems we will have to implement the serial expansion board as a standalone board using the PIC18F85J94 being planned to be used in production board.</li><li>It is also advisable to remove the control serial port currently implemented in Cypress FX2LP in order to free up endpoints for UVC A/B preview and HDMI audio input.</li></ul></div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ptzfortimvideos-gsoc14.blogspot.com/\">Serial port expansion for HDMI2USB with PTZ camera control example</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
