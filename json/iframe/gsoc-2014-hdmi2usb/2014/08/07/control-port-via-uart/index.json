{"title":"Control port via UART","created_at":"2014-08-07 18:10:00 UTC","author":"Ajit (MJPEG Optimisation)","content":"<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\">This is turning out to be more difficult than I thought. I was trying to use the same controller module for cdc and UART. But for some reason which I haven't been able to figure out, the video output is null when I am trying to do that. Tried a bunch of stuff but nothing worked. I guess I will have to make a separate controller for UART. </div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ajitmathewgsoc.blogspot.com/\">TimVideo GSoC 2014: MJPEG Optimisation</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
