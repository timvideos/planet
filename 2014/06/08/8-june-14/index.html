<li>I implemented location detection in my app today using pygeoip.</li>
<li>I detected user network bandwidth by downloading an image at a URL using JS and timing it. This method gives network speed fairly close to as measured by other online speedtests. </li>
<li>I toyed with html2canvas and implemented a dummy. </li>
<li>I was wondering about the possible options we have for storing the generated client-end screenshots. I talked to skay and we came up with the following: 

<ul>
<li>Use a web service like s3 (AWS)</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://api.imgur.com/">Imgur API</a>. It offers a limit of 1250 uploads per day, according to docs. We can also apply for getting our app white-listed because it&rsquo;s free for all. </li>
<li>Save them locally on our server. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Thought for the day</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Never let the perfect be the enemy of the good&rdquo;: Don&rsquo;t delay something in order to make it perfect when it already is good enough. </p><div class="author">
