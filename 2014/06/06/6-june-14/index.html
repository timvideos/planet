---<p>I initialized a <a href="https://github.com/Niharika29/bugtracker">new git repo</a> from the 2-scoops-of-django template. Messed with the javascript and templates a bit. Got a feel of the environment. Also got to learn more about virtualenv and usage. The repo is initialized with Django 1.6.5. </p><div class="author">
