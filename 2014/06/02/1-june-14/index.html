---<p>Skay told me that a Django-based form would be preferable to an HTML one, so today I&rsquo;m going to make the form properly, in Django. </p>

<p>Done with the form but I&rsquo;m facing a weird error: ´A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator´ on accessing some specific URLs in the project site. Like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/m6y2wqket1gasuf/Screenshot%202014-06-01%2019.28.57.png">this</a>. No idea what&rsquo;s going on. </p>

<p>The complete stack trace from doing the make serve can be found <a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com/7567179">here</a>.
My code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Niharika29/streaming-system/tree/master/website/frontend">here</a>.</p>

<p>PS: I&rsquo;ll be a little less available over the next few days because of exam on Wednesday and Friday.</p><div class="author">
