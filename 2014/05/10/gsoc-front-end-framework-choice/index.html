---Today I had to choose which front-end framework I would like to use in Tim Videos project.<br /><br />Today's choice is really huge and that choice make decision even harder, but on the other hand with every modern front-end framework you will get the same results and features: responsive design, fully customization of colors, shapes, etc. grid system, icons, customized forms, buttons, etc.<br /><br />I have some experience with 2 front-end frameworks: Bootrap and Pure CSS, and I think I will choose one of them, but I made some research to find some alternatives and make a choice.<br /><br />Alex Ivanovs wrote on<i> Flippin' Awesome</i> blog great post about Bootstrap alternatives:&nbsp;<a href="http://flippinawesome.org/2014/02/17/8-bootstrap-alternatives/">http://flippinawesome.org/2014/02/17/8-bootstrap-alternatives/</a>. I recommend to read it and comments below, because it is a great source of information about modern front-end frameworks. I also recommend to look at spreadsheet of&nbsp;<i>Styleguide &amp; Boilerplate Patterns </i>from&nbsp;Tyler Sticka (<a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/common-patterns/">Cloud Four</a>) with comparison of most popular front-end frameworks and its features: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiN0QfBTPpOCdDFjWlM0eU1ra21XanZkekxGbjA2WWc">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiN0QfBTPpOCdDFjWlM0eU1ra21XanZkekxGbjA2WWc</a>.<br /><br />I did not make a choice yet, currently I am preparing some mockups of website, after that I will choose framework that suits all my needs.<br /><br /><br /><div class="author">
