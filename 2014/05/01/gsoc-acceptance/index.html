---<h2>I was accepted to GSoC 2014!!</h2>

<p>So my <a href="http://mstritzi.nfshost.com/blog/index.php/posts/gsoc-2014-dockerizing-flumotion">proposal</a> was accepted by TimVideos! I found out about a week ago that starting May 19th I'll be starting and fulfilling the proposal.</p>

<p>I'm very excited about this and can't wait to begin work! </p><div class="author">
