---I worked half a day on Wednesday and was out of town on Thursday. On Friday, i was home the whole day as i was not feeling well. You can ask so what?<br /><br />Now the plan is to work on the weekend to complete the 40 hours as well as next week during which i am suppose to be on vacation.<br /><br />I had taken GSoC on my nerves. That is why my sleep and work cycle got unbalanced this week. I want to unwind myself and today (Friday) i focused on that. My goal is to complete the project and enjoy the experience rather than hosed.<br /><br />Anyway, got MyHDL 0.9-dev working. Now i can pass interfaces.

I have to resolve this with the mentor.</strike><br /><br />Tomorrow (Saturday May 31st), integration of simulation models of Image Buffer -&gt; RTP -&gt; UDP in MyHDL will be dealt with.<br /><br /><br /><div class="author">
