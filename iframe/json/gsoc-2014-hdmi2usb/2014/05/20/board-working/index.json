I had initially used Adept and fxloader to flash the firmware but it turns out there seems to be a problem with fxloader. So I used libFPGAlink. I used the wiki by mithro on the same and after some efforts things starts to work.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aiPUwbQL0Rw/U3s4lUmdRWI/AAAAAAAAAJg/Yf3C10FSV0c/s1600/IMG_20140519_162614.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aiPUwbQL0Rw/U3s4lUmdRWI/AAAAAAAAAJg/Yf3C10FSV0c/s1600/IMG_20140519_162614.jpg\" height=\"640\" width=\"582\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">(Lets ignore the tooth brush)</div>Now I am planning to try to improve the frequency of the operation of the JPEG encoder. Simulations show that at 100Mhz, 20Hz can be achieved for 1080p images. I am planning to run smartXplorer on the design and see which mapping and PAR strategy is the best. Also I will try to removing the timing violation as ISE slows other parts of the design to meet the timing requirements. So lets see how things work out.</div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ajitmathewgsoc.blogspot.com/\">TimVideo GSoC 2014: MJPEG Optimisation</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
