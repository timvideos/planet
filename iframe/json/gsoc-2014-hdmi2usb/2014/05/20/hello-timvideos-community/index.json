I will be modifying the firmware in Cypress FX2LP so that two additional USB virtual serial ports are available on HDMI2USB and I will create mappings for their end-points buffers to external hardware through the FPGA. <br /><br />First virtual serial port will be used as a sink for PTZ camera control pipeline, and will be mapped inside the FPGA to a Serial Expansion Board for VHDCI on Digilent Atlys which then connects through a cable to the control port(s) of PTZ camera(s).<br /><br />The other virtual serial port will be kept for future use by any other pipeline and will be mapped by the FPGA to a GPIO header on the serial expansion board for exchanging data with additional peripherals like<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_light\"> tally lights</a>, indicators, IR remote etc.<br /><br />Lastly, this system will be integrated and tested with the existing PTZ control libraries.<br /><br />The serial expansion board circuit and firmware changes will also be usable in the Numato production board design for HDMI2USB which is under development.<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Please take a look at my <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/public/google/gsoc2014/ayush3504/5662278724616192\" target=\"_blank\">Google Summer of Code 2014 Proposal for TimVideos</a>&nbsp;| (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo1KzMPjOsmW_SPl2klxFreTU87Zn2Any1NbeCsfYi4\" target=\"_blank\">google doc</a>)</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">About me:</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">I’m Ayush Sagar and I'm currently pursuing masters in Power Electronics in Hyderabad, India. In free time I like watching online courses, gadget reviews and fixing and cracking-open things around. Apart from college stuff I like watching online courses, gadget reviews and fixing and cracking-open things around. I’m very excited to be working on this project with <a href=\"http://code.timvideos.us/Home.html\">TimVideos</a> community during this summer because among other cool things to learn in a FOSS community this will give me a gentle start on VHDL (on Xilinx Spartan 6) and USB protocols.</div></div></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/ayushsagar\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/ayushsagar</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;IRC nick: ayush3504</div><div><br /></div></div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ptzfortimvideos-gsoc14.blogspot.com/\">Serial port expansion for HDMI2USB with PTZ camera control example</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
