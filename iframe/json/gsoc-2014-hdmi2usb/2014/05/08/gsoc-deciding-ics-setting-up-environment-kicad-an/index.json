{"title":"[GSoC] Deciding ICs, setting up environment, KiCad and more...","created_at":"2014-05-08 18:52:00 UTC","author":"Rohit (VGA Extension)","content":"<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\"><div>So the last time I talked, I said about ordering Atlys for the project. And, the awesome news is that Atlys got delivered <i>today itself</i>! [Although, Digilent's distributors in India did take a long time to ship it]. I'm very excited to try it. <br /><br /><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tZRt786kGn0/U2vbdDGypOI/AAAAAAAABqw/Ws_ipM9pGaQ/s1600/DSC00382.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tZRt786kGn0/U2vbdDGypOI/AAAAAAAABqw/Ws_ipM9pGaQ/s1600/DSC00382.JPG\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Brand new Atlys Box!</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dCZocsQI2e0/U2vd6CWryEI/AAAAAAAABrY/ODenzzS26mQ/s1600/DSC00391.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dCZocsQI2e0/U2vd6CWryEI/AAAAAAAABrY/ODenzzS26mQ/s1600/DSC00391.JPG\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Atlys outside its packaging</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>Some, important highlights of the days spent:<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Deciding IC<span style=\"font-size: small;\">s</span>:</span></h4><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Deciding which IC to use was a very important and critical decision for the project. The Texas Instruments' TVP7002 which was initially a good option has now been made NRND (Not Recommended for New Designs) by TI. So, this was the first setback, since they don't sample NRND products and I could have got them through TI Samples program, if that wasn't the case. </div>There were also some other options from Analog Devices, namely,<br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>AD9984A (original choice)</li><li>ADV7604</li><li>AD9985A (NRND)</li></ul></div>The problem with AD9985A was it is older(NRND) with less sampling frequency(140 MSPS) and Bit-resolution(8-bit)  and Display resolution(SXGA: 1280 × 1024 at 75 Hz)). The AD9984A seems better than AD9985A, with 170 MSPS, 10-bit and max resolution of UXGA (1600 × 1200 at 60 Hz).<br /><br />The ADV7604 is another beast altogether. It has excellent capabilities, with only major problem being its cost and the BGA packaging (which is risky of project of this scale)<br /><br />TVP7002 also requires unconventional, but not that it can't be done, 1.9V supply.<br /><br />In the end, we decided to go with AD9984A as the preferred IC for this project and keep the TVP7002 as a backup is case of any problems.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Learning KiCad:</span></h4><div style=\"text-align: left;\">I started learning KiCad from scratch with the help of <a href=\"http://contextualelectronics.com/buildpcbs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">excellent video tutorial series</a> by <span class=\"st\">Chris Gammell</span>. Initially, KiCad seemed very tedious to me, a long-time eagle user, but now I have definitely improved upto 80% of the capability I had on Eagle, and damn, KiCad's keyboard shortcuts are highly addictive! I love them! Never had the habit of using Keyboard shortcuts in Eagle.&nbsp;</div>Made few schematics and PCB, same as that were used in the tutorial videos. Overall, KiCad is nice up-till now as I've started with the alpha version schematics. Rest, I'll be giving regular feedback on KiCad as the design progresses.<br /><br /><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Setting up environment:</span></h4>Ahh! This was very time consuming. I realized that my Laptop HDD's partitioning for Windows and Linux were inadequate and also very less space left for any expansion. I had Xilinx ISE on windows, but for this project I needed the latest Xilinx ISE on Ubuntu 12.04. This would take another ~15GBs. I didn't have space this much. So, the last resort was to upgrade the HDD. <br />Copying data as it is, even boot configuration, was a very slow and tedious job. Almost 2 days were lost in this, but data migration got completed successfully. <br />Next came time for installing ISE on Ubuntu. First, sourcing ISE itself is a tough task on slow net connections. But I had planned in advance and had started downloading it much earlier.<br />Finally, ISE part is set up properly. Since, I've now got the Atlys board, I can now set up the Cypress and Digilent toolchains.<br /><br /><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Other Procurements:</span></h4>I also ordered 6x VHDCI Connectors and 1x VMod-BB from the Digilent site directly. They got delivered in 4 days (shipping from US) as opposed to Atlys which took more than 10 days from payment to get delivered! <br /><br /><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Exam Season!</span></h4>And then, we have here in India, this time of exams, in almost all colleges. I had to spend 3 days for the practical exams, which thankfully are over now. But, its just a silence before storm!! We have got around 12 days, after which the Theory Exams will start! #BracingForTheExams<br /><br /><br />Standby by for a new post next week! with alpha design of PCB and some Atlys tests! Good Bye!<br /><br />Some More pictures of Atlys! Enjoy:)<br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TKKlMK00k_8/U2vchdAF0GI/AAAAAAAABrE/fKeOOJoucVk/s1600/DSC00388.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TKKlMK00k_8/U2vchdAF0GI/AAAAAAAABrE/fKeOOJoucVk/s1600/DSC00388.JPG\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--jZZVRAnNnA/U2vchryjTFI/AAAAAAAABrI/yKSd_RtyyK8/s1600/DSC00389.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--jZZVRAnNnA/U2vchryjTFI/AAAAAAAABrI/yKSd_RtyyK8/s1600/DSC00389.JPG\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WihgqtVCLyY/U2vcltsOOtI/AAAAAAAABrQ/ikzLV-Qi1Rs/s1600/DSC00390.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WihgqtVCLyY/U2vcltsOOtI/AAAAAAAABrQ/ikzLV-Qi1Rs/s1600/DSC00390.JPG\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7tsYtCkrwg4/U2vd6CnrcII/AAAAAAAABro/8BezEotv_Jw/s1600/DSC00392.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7tsYtCkrwg4/U2vd6CnrcII/AAAAAAAABro/8BezEotv_Jw/s1600/DSC00392.JPG\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oaXlFp5ZGJE/U2vd6q4M1DI/AAAAAAAABrs/sf5qA5L9kK4/s1600/DSC00396.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oaXlFp5ZGJE/U2vd6q4M1DI/AAAAAAAABrs/sf5qA5L9kK4/s1600/DSC00396.JPG\" height=\"150\" width=\"200\" /></a></div><br /></div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://dreamsxtrinsic.blogspot.com/\">Dreams eXtrinsic</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
