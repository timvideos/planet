{"title":"Daily snippet - 2x","created_at":"2014-06-07 13:39:00 UTC","author":"Ayush (PTZ/Serial Extension)","content":"<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\"><br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>Following a modular approach, the serial expansion board will have a base board and serial adapters.</li><li>The base board would have 6 x RS232C true serial ports with DB9 connectors which would make base board very useful by itself. The DB9 connectors also has excellent mechanical stability for connecting these additional adapters. Now these serial ports could be used directly with VISCA cable or can connect to any other serial device available on internet. I wonder if a serial mouse would work if I connect it to this serial expansion board...</li><li>The serial adapters would be - Serial-GPIO, Serial-RS485. A Serial-DMX adapter can be designed - the protocol is easy, but since a market option is available, will do this only if I run out of things to do. Even RS-232 to RS485 adapters are available to buy, will go through market offerings to see if I need to make one or not.</li><li>Wondering how I would feed power to the serial-adapters using the base board. I might use the RTS line as explained <a href=\"http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/rspower.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and provide a jumper to disable it.</li><li>On the other hand, I would like my serial adapters to be usable with other USB-Serial adapters, in case someone wants to use it that way. How should I power it... maybe a 5V DC jack should also be there.</li><li>To add more value to this board, I'm planing to give complete galvanic isolation instead of ESD chips.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xIML-TEmq--nJXuKta11v-6DK-Rkrs5hGJjJTQXrQUg/edit#\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a> is a draft specification document for the serial expansion board. Have to enter board design drawings and circuit design. May be, this will end up being the documentation in my repository :)</li></ul></div><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://ptzfortimvideos-gsoc14.blogspot.com/\">Serial port expansion for HDMI2USB with PTZ camera control example</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
