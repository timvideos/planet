Focuses only on the writing part, everything else faded in the background. I was looking for a new blogging platform for my Google Summer of Code journey and my first choice was <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a> but it turned out to not be free, which made me look for other platforms. But I couldn&rsquo;t have hoped for something better than svbtle. It&rsquo;s nice and simple. Looking forward to blogging and codingmy summer away!</p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://niharika.svbtle.com\">Niharika Kohli</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
