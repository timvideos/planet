I&rsquo;ve been playing around with the streaming system since the last couple of days. Trying to figure out how components connect. My speed is a bit slow at the moment because I am new to Django. \nI did add a Report Bug button on the streaming system. It&rsquo;s temporarily placed in the footer. Next I am trying to direct it to a new page where I fetch and display all relevant information. This is just for testing that I am going the right way. I will add all this information to a database once I make sure that I fetch all the right and necessary data.</p><div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://niharika.svbtle.com\">Niharika Kohli</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
