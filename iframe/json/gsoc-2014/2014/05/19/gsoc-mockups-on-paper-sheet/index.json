{"title":"[GSoC] Mockups on paper sheet","created_at":"2014-05-19 19:17:00 UTC","author":"Maciej (Developer Website)","content":"Last few days I spend on preparing mockups of website on paper sheet. It's a great method to create design without using your computer, graphic editing program, etc. It can help you with creating your design without thinking about css, html or javascript. Peiter Buick and Lyndon Gerejo from Smashing Magazine wrote great articles about sketching your website and preparing good design (you can read it on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/13/the-messy-art-of-ux-sketching/\">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/13/the-messy-art-of-ux-sketching/</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/16/design-better-faster-with-rapid-prototyping/\">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/16/design-better-faster-with-rapid-prototyping/</a>).<br /><br />I used a lot of paper sheets and read and looked at hundreds website to find inspirations for Tim Videos website. I am still learning and need more experience in ux/ui design, but I do my best to prepare awesome website.<br /><br />Today I've seen an article from Chris Spooner (<a href=\"http://line25.com/articles/modern-examples-of-the-classic-sidebar-menu-layout\">http://line25.com/articles/modern-examples-of-the-classic-sidebar-menu-layout</a>) about classic sidebars on modern websites and I thought that's a great idea for Tim Videos page, where content should be most important). As you can see below I've prepared some mockups on paper with sidebar and content placed in blocks (like on Google+ or Facebook). Blocks should be adaptive to screen width, and user should see only legible content on smartphone, tablet or computer screen.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ECLz8g3TWtE/U3pTeZHUSYI/AAAAAAAAH6Y/GKbN61UTN8Y/s1600/IMG_20140519_184120.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ECLz8g3TWtE/U3pTeZHUSYI/AAAAAAAAH6Y/GKbN61UTN8Y/s1600/IMG_20140519_184120.jpg\" height=\"300\" width=\"400\" /></a></div><br />Tomorrow I will try prepare some mockups with more colors. I would like to use colors from my last mockup (#2).<br /><br />I hope you will like it. :)<div class=\"author\">\n  <span>\n    <i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http://pinoit.blogspot.com\">pino IT / ruby / developer</a></i>\n  </span>\n</div>\n"}
