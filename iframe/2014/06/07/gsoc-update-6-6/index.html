---<h2>Snippets</h2>

<ul>
<li>Consulted with mentor about config details, decided on using docker environment variables for application config</li>
<li>Struggled a bit with configuring collector/encoder connectivity, but feel comfortable starting these docker containers from command line</li>
<li>glanced briefly at watchdog/register scripts for hooking into front-end, have yet to test fully</li>
</ul>

<p>updates might be a bit brief for the next couple days, I have some very hard finals ahead. </p><div class="author">
