---<h2>Snippets</h2>

<ul>
<li>checked out https://github.com/timvideos/streaming-system/issues/56#issuecomment-45690761</li>
<li>I think the above is pretty similar to what I already have(as far as I can tell), so not going to worry too much about switching</li>
<li>have been doing some reading on Chef wrt docker and this project. Investigation shows <a href="https://github.com/opscode/chef-metal">chef-metal</a> to look like a good choice. I will still need to use cobblerd however as PXE is not currently supported. </li>
<li>I think something similar to <a href="http://tech.paulcz.net/2013/09/creating-immutable-servers-with-chef-and-docker-dot-io.html">this</a> is what we want our containers to end up being like.</li>
