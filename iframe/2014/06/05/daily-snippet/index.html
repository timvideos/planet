---<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">As I am planning to write a test bench to simulate HDMI2USB, I spent most of the day trying to understand the TMSB protocol as I had not encountered it earlier. I was finally able to write a code which generates TMSB signal given RGB values.<br /><br />Work for Today: Understand the working of DDR2 ram and simulate it successfully.
