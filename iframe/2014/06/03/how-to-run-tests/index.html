---<p>Running all the tests in module was broken due to mixing of gobject and gi. So, I’ve created a <code>working-tests.txt</code> and a <code>run_tests.sh</code> to read this file and run the tests. As a result, Travis build is passing now as seen on badge on sidebar of this blog.</p>

<p>Again with the Gstreamer version 1.2.1 issues, some overrides are not implemented (like Gst.Fraction class). So, I’m adding the implementation myself (which I shall remove when the whole thing is ported).</p><div class="author">
