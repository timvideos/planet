---One of needments for TimVideos website is easy and fast interface for edit. Since page will be hosted on GitHub pages there is no way to use one of common CMSes like Wordpress, Radiant CMS or other, we need something that will work with GitHub repository without need for external server.<br />There are many Markdown editors in the Internet: Markable, Dillinger.io or StackEdit, but they cannot connect with GitHub, they are just editors for Markdown, nothings more (except sharing, saving as a file, preview, etc.)<br /><br />Fortunately there is an editor with fully integration with GitGub and mostly client-side (needs only very small application on server, because of lack of GitHub authentication).<br />I would like to use Prose.io with our application, you can check it on <a href="http://prose.io/">http://prose.io</a>, or source on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/prose/prose">https://github.com/prose/prose</a><br /><br />I would like to write some pros and cons for prose.io<br /><br /><b>Advantages</b><br /><br /><ul><li>almost fully client-side,</li><li>full integration with GitHub (you can commit your changes, load your repositories, etc.),</li><li>easy to maintain and combine with jekyll (check <a href="https://github.com/prose/starter">https://github.com/prose/starter</a>),</li><li>nice editor with preview (and can edit metadata too),</li><li>build especially for jekyll,</li><li>you don't need to know git to change your website,</li></ul><div><b>Disadvantages</b></div><div><ul><li>you need to have small application for authentication on server (called gatekeeper),</li><li>you need to know something about web application to configure jekyll and prose.io,</li><li>it requires access to all your repositories, both private and public (unless you are running prose.io on your server:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maxmasnick.com/2012/07/03/prose/">http://www.maxmasnick.com/2012/07/03/prose/</a>)</li></ul><div>Currently I am still working on design, but I can't wait to combine Prose.io and Jekyll and create easy to maintain website.&nbsp;</div></div><div class="author">
